# zfb / zudo-front-builder

Workspace for the `zfb` Rust workspace + `@takazudo/zfb-runtime` and `zfb` npm packages. The repo is one of the 4 zfb-side Phase A epics under super-epic [zudolab/zudo-doc#473](https://github.com/zudolab/zudo-doc/issues/473) — the Astro→zfb migration.

## /x-wt-teams epic workflow rule

For each `[Epic]` issue in this repo (e.g. issues #52, #53, and the rest of the super-epic's zfb-side epics), the epic PR is independent and safe to merge into `main` as soon as its workflow completes — siblings do not stack on one base. So:

- **Always invoke `/x-wt-teams` with `-a` / `--auto`** for an epic in this repo (in addition to whatever other flags the user passes — `-gcoc`, `--stay`, etc.). `-a` runs `/pr-complete -c -w` after Step 15, which merges the root PR, closes the linked issue, and watches post-merge CI on `main`.
- **After the merge succeeds**, the workflow's auto-suggest step prints the next epic's `/x-wt-teams` command for the user to copy-paste. Do not start the next epic in the same session.
- If the user explicitly says "do NOT auto-merge" or passes a flag that conflicts with `-a`, defer to the user.
- This rule is specific to `[Epic]` issues. Non-epic issues (one-off bug fixes, follow-ups like #58 inside an open epic PR) keep the default behaviour — leave the PR open for the user to review.
